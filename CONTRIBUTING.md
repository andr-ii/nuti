## The Contributing Guide

Hey!

If you would like to add/improve something at `nuti` project - feel free to do it! :)

Just follow simple guideline:

1. Create an `issue` with clear description (what needs to be done).

2. Create a `pull request` which will be related to this `issue`.

3. Please keep in mind that `test coverage` requires to be at least 99%.
It is not necessary to write all of the unit tests. A few integrational,
which check how the feature works and cover all new code will be just great!

4. Before creating a `commit` - make sure `npm run hooks` was done and
`commit-message` and `pre-commit` hooks are working.

5. Once all PR requirements are met (review, resolved comments, ci-workflow) it
can be merged! ðŸ˜Ž
